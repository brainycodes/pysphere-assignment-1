# Ohm's Law Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates **Voltage (V)** using **Ohm's Law**:

\[
V = I \times R
\]

where:  
- `V` = Voltage (volts)  
- `I` = Current (amperes)  
- `R` = Resistance (ohms)

## How it works
1. The program asks the user to enter the **current (I)** and the **resistance (R)**.  
2. It then calculates the voltage using the formula `V = I * R`.  
3. Finally, it prints the result.
