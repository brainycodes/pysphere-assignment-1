# Ohm's Law Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates **Voltage (V)** using **Ohm's Law**:

\[
V = I \times R
\]

where:  
- `V` = Voltage (volts)  
- `I` = Current (amperes)  
- `R` = Resistance (ohms)  

---

## How it works
1. The program asks the user to enter the **current (I)** and the **resistance (R)**.  
2. It then calculates the voltage using the formula `V = I * R`.  
3. Finally, it prints the result.

## Example

Enter the current (in A): 3
Enter the resistance (in ohms): 10
The voltage is: 30 volts

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python installed**.  
2. Clone or download this project.  
3. Open a terminal in the project folder.  
4. Run the program:

```bash
python ohms_law.py
